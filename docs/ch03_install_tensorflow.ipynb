    "## 1. Tensorflow - Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has a clean, modular architecture with multiple frontends(interface) and execution platforms. \n",
    "- Since it uses symbolic graph of vector operations approach, specifying a new network is fairly easy.\n",
    "- The graph visualization can help you understand and debug them using TensorBoard. \n",
    "- Though it’s the newest member of the Python deep learning library collection, its community is large because it’s backed by the Google Brain team.\n",
    "-  Users can scale-up and train that model faster on GPUs with no code changes\n",
    "- It has a major weakness in terms of modeling flexibility. Every computational flow has be constructed as a static graph. That makes some computations difficult,\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Tensorflow - Basics\n",
    "TensorFlow is a programming system in which you represent computations as graphs. Nodes in the graph are called ops (short for operations). An op takes zero or more Tensors, performs some computation, and produces zero or more Tensors. A Tensor is a typed multi-dimensional array. \n",
    "  \n",
    "### - You might think of TensorFlow Core programs as consisting of two discrete sections   \n",
    "1.Building the computational graph & 2.Running the computational graph \n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "### - Computational graph\n",
    "A computational graph is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes. Notice that printing the nodes in the following code does not output the values.   \n",
    "   \n",
    "> node1 = tf.constant(3.0, tf.float32)   \n",
    "> node2 = tf.constant(4.0, tf.float32)   \n",

    "### - Session\n",
    "A session encapsulates the control and state of the TensorFlow runtime. To actually evaluate the node, we must run the computational graph within a session. The following code creates a Session object and then invokes its run method to run enough of the computational graph to evaluate the nodes. \n",

    "> a = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)  \n",
    "> b = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)  \n",
    "> adder_node = a + b   \n",
